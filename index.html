            <br> You are proud as a master poet,<br> Poetic soul with rhythmical intellect,<br> Verse and prose comes
            from you imaginative wit,<br> Be laud with a prolific languages steal our spirit.<br>
            <br> One sadden moment I read your poetry,<br> Deep with significant messages, got pity with my
            vocabulary,<br> What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.<br> Bravo, hooray! , , , it
            hooked my heart amazingly,<br>
            <br> A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,<br> Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide,
            no it can't be,<br> Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,<br> Not a genuine poet; with false
            charade and intelligence.<br>
            <br> Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,<br> Words are flowery so as lines are always with
            doubt,<br> Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,<br> Craft your poem with honesty and
            integrity, please do my dear
            poet.
